# AWS-App

Expanding my knowledge in cloud computing.
Currently learning the most commonly used AWS services, such as EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, RDS, Lamda, Route53, DynamoDB, Cloudwatch, etc...

Because of the costs of aws services, these instances are not running always. So that's the reason why I will upload images without links to created resources.
