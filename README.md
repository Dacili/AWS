# AWS - Amazon Web Services

Expanding my knowledge in cloud computing.
Currently learning the most commonly used AWS services, such as EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, S3, RDS, Lamda, Route53, DynamoDB, Cloudwatch, etc...

Because of the costs of aws services, these instances are not running always. So that's the reason why I will upload images without links to created resources.

Elastic beanstalk - for hosting your web apps (you don't manage separately services, elastic beanstalk do it for you :D)

EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud) - similar to a virtual machine (VM)

S3 (Simple storage service) - storage that contains buckets (think of it as folders), in buckets you are putting the files.

Currently in progress...
